#CLASS ENGINEER#ENUMERATION 27tagSkillClassDescriptionEngineer=^k帝国军队内男性和女性高学历群体的工程师们负责研发巨大的战争机器，以有效手段摧毁其敌方人员和设施。很少看见他们在恐怖黎明前的一线行动，但是仍然能够用飞行中释放的玩意儿来打击他们的敌人。工程师们往往喜欢使用枪械，但有些性急的人已经设计出方法来增强自己的拳头。tagClassEngineerSkillName00=^k机师tagClassEngineerSkillDescription00=尤利卡！tagClassEngineerSkillName01A=雪莉的激波抛射器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01A=Shirley was the first to invent a powerful firearm augment which was both cheap and easy to mass-produce. The apparatus connects to ranged weapons and will electrify rounds automatically. These electrified rounds are powerful enough to occasionally shock an enemy off their feet. {^N}^o需要装备远程武器。默认攻击。tagClassEngineerSkillName01B=电晕充电盒^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01B=Improves the shock apparatus to also cause rounds to release a devastating corona of electric energy when hitting a target.tagClassEngineerSkillName01C=奇妙冷凝器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01C=Adds an aether condenser to the shock apparatus, causing all fired projectiles to become very brittle and brimming with aetherial energy just waiting to be let out.tagClassEngineerSkillName01D=紫红火箭弹^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription01D=A bulky revision of Shirley's original design, using an arcane amplifier to add a bit of magical heft to fired rounds. Requires more energy, but packs a much greater punch.tagClassEngineerSkillName02A=帕斯卡的气动能量掌^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02A=Pascal was a rowdy one, obsessed with lining armor with special pneumatic devices to increase the stopping power of punches. The devices take a moment to warm up, but will increase your punching power greatly after that. Unfortunately, his design is surprisingly useless when it comes to swinging a weapon. {^N}^o需要你徒手不拿武器。默认攻击。tagClassEngineerSkillName02B=大师的油腻手柄^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02B=A technique inspired by the grandmaster engineer of the imperial army, whose hands always seemed to be covered in oil.tagClassEngineerSkillName02C=手持危害投掷器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02C=Every punch will cause small explosive devices to be launched forward into several nearby enemies' faces at extremely high speeds. Devious, Dangerous, Imperial Engineering.tagClassEngineerSkillName02D=制伏振荡器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02D=Pascal's original design can be tweaked to output much more power, but initial testing proved human arms can't handle the stress. In fact, the first tester's arms launched off his body like missiles after a few moments of intense high-frequency punching. Since having arms is a prerequisite for punching, users of this tweak are advised to slow down a bit.tagClassEngineerSkillName02E=无视安全标签^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription02E=Safety be damned! You want power, and you're confident your arms can handle these things at full capacity. You laugh at the thought of your arms shooting off your torso like missiles! Probably because that's actually a pretty funny thought to have.tagClassEngineerSkillName03A=哈利的免提超小玩意儿^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription03A=With deft hands and a series of clever techniques, Harry was able to provide boosts to the performance of summons, but only for short periods of time. However, there's no way you could possibly pull this off while holding a weapon. {^N}^o需要你徒手不拿武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName04A=塞缪尔的固定式哨所^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04A=A simple stationary turret which exists for the sole purpose of shooting powerful rounds at enemies. No frills. Samuel had plans to make his creation mobile, but that required more power than it was capable of outputting. He settled for a stationary, but powerful, deployable defensive line. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetSentry=哨所火炮tagClassEngineerSentryAttack=远程重炮tagClassEngineerSkillName04B=汲取经验：哨所^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04B=From using the sentry in combat, you've learned a thing or two about summons, defense, and apparently walking slightly faster.tagClassEngineerSkillName04C=标志仿品：哨所^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription04C=Prolonged use of the sentry has given you an idea. You have gained the ability to sacrifice your movement speed for the ability to take on aspects of your Sentry Gun. {^N}^o这是可触发的被动技能。tagClassEngineerSkillName05A=康妮的带电炮弹^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05A=With a bit of help from some of her arcanist friends, Connie created a gadget which allowed a standard firearm to propel a volatile cannonball forward. With a bit of aetherial energy and a few quick movements to set up a shot, anything is possible! {^N}^o需要装备远程武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName05B=快速复制钻机^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05B=It is a well known fact that aetherial energy is strange, unpredictable, and alien. However, its effects start to get especially strange when you manage to compress enough of it into one small place. Increasing efforts to improve the cannonball firing method led to an amusing discovery: more cannonballs!tagClassEngineerSkillName05C=缴获的军械^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription05C=All of this aether nonsense really corrupted the initial goal of the Cannonball project: Crowd control. These modifications aim to help bring the project back to its roots.tagClassEngineerSkillName06A=托米的草坪翻转器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription06A=Tommy saw the appeal of unarmed techniques and gadgets, but not so much for combat. He started using powerful arm augments to help him do his gardening work, and it worked quite well for turning soil. Higher-ups caught wind of this, and asked for his methods to be upgraded for combat use. Reluctantly, Tommy made the required tweaks and his gardening tool became a powerful ground-pound. {^N}^o需要你徒手不拿武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName06B=火法穿孔^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription06B=Adds a bit of power and a bit of fire. The added power is just enough to start knocking certain targets off their feet.tagClassEngineerSkillName07A=斯坦利的安全空间^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07A=This "Safe Space" machine keeps your enemies at bay with invisible, punishing waves of energy for a short time before breaking down. Stanley made great efforts to sustain the machine longer, but it has the unfortunate tendency of tearing itself apart. This version of the machine is 30% less likely to maliciously reorganize its creator's internal organs. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetSafeSpace=安全空间发生器tagClassEngineerSafeSpaceAttack=安全空间tagClassEngineerSkillName07B=汲取经验：安全空间^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07B=Use of the Safe Space Bot has led you to the discovery of a few defensive techniques. These techniques are applicable to both yourself and your summons.tagClassEngineerSkillName07C=标志仿品：安全空间^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription07C=In your attempts to take on aspects of the Safe Space Bot, you found that attempting to release energy similar to the machine was rather unhealthy for your internal organs. Instead, you focused on the aspects of survival which the machine stands for. You can use this to increase your survivability in several aspects. {^N}^o这是可触发的被动技能。tagClassEngineerSkillName08A=弗兰克的遥感探测器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription08A=Many of the fantastical inventions and techniques Engineers are capable of utilizing require absurd amounts of energy to work. Frankie used her knowledge to develop a small device which will put the user into a meditative state. In this state, reaction time is greatly decreased, but the user will quickly feel completely revitalized. Once revitalized, it is recommended to turn the device off, as it will have no further beneficial effects to your state of being. {^N}^o这是可触发的被动技能。tagClassEngineerSkillName09A=保罗的现场冲压机^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription09A=Engineers know how to tinker, but they aren't the greatest athletes. While arm mechanisms can improve the power, they can't improve the form. Paul decided to spend some time learning how to actually punch, and then he presented his findings so other engineers would be able to quickly learn. {^N}^o需要你徒手不拿武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName10A=德里克的肮脏发射器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription10A=All enemies have weak spots, it's just a matter of knowing where to shoot. Derek compiled a large tome filled with information on the weak spots of all known creatures, a tome which many engineers facing combat situations will often study on a regular basis. {^N}^o需要装备远程武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName11A=艾萨克的实时燃烧弹^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription11A=Isaac, like many Engineers, had a passion for fire. The technology for flamethrowers had existed for a long time, but Isaac was the first to adapt it to a easily-deployable version that is durable enough to not explode constantly. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetFlamerBot=喷火机器人tagClassEngineerFlamerAttack=喷火器tagClassEngineerSkillName11B=汲取经验：燃烧设施^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription11B=The Flamer Bot has impressively resistant casing to protect its fuel. After seeing it in action, you think you can adapt it for your other summons.tagClassEngineerSkillName11C=标志仿品：燃烧设施^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription11C=Spitting fire is unhealthy for your face, but it may be possible to focus your energy into imitating the high resistance of the Flamer Bot. {^N}^o这是可触发的被动技能。tagClassEngineerSkillName12A=速载装置^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription12A=A simple overdrive device will briefly route extra power to servos in your armor allowing for faster punches. {^N}^o需要你徒手不拿武器。tagClassEngineerSkillName12B=折磨废气^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription12B=Let off some extra steam, and damage your enemies in the process. The extra heat also increases fire damage.tagClassEngineerSkillName12C=改进机能^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription12C=This modification to the original device will speed up all of your other bodily functions for that extra edge in battle. And yes, all of them.tagClassEngineerSkillName13A=笨拙的隐匿术^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescription13A=The creator of this technique was shunned for their eldritch tampering. Their name has been struck from all official documents and effectively lost to history. Hell, this technique doesn't even have a cool alliterated name. That's really saying something, since ignoring such a naming convention is blatantly against the Empire's Engineering Edicts and punishable by death. All that aside, you figured you'd try it out. It seems to imbue your attacks with a strange energy, occasionally causing a sentry to appear nearby with a flash of light and a chill down your spine. These turrets seem normal enough, but I'm an omniscient tooltip and trust me, I know better. {^N}^o这是可触发的被动技能。召唤哨兵将受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetSinisterSentry=纯机械哨兵tagClassEngineerSkillNameSoldier=高级重型火炮^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionSoldier=The standard sentries are nice, but you have to throw so many of them down at the start of every battle. Such a hassle. It would be nice to have something with a little more battlefield presence to back you up, giving you more time to do whatever it is you do when you're not spamming turrets. This is that thing. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetSoldier=重型火炮tagClassEngineerPetSoldierAttack=火炮射击tagClassEngineerSkillNameDemo=罐式炸弹加工机^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionDemo=Canister Bombs are extremely useful, and they would be even more useful if you could have more of them delivered straight to your enemies' faces. Can't say no to more explosions. This machine will create Canister Bombs on a regular basis, and it will launch them at your enemies for you so you can sit back and watch the destruction. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetDemo=罐式炸弹加工机tagClassEngineerPetDemoAttack=大规模生产的罐式炸弹tagClassEngineerSkillNameOccultist=瘟疫撒播器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionOccultist=With this thing, you'll definitely be harming whatever's left of the ecosystem. It's mostly terrible, though, so don't feel too bad. Come to think of it, killing all life might actually be a dramatic improvement, considering the current state of things. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetOccultist=瘟疫撒播器tagClassEngineerPetOccultistAttack=瘟疫蔓延tagClassEngineerSkillNameNightblade=怪音发声器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionNightblade=By now, you're getting pretty tired of taking hits. You can avoid a lot of them, sure, but you're pretty sure they're having more fun trying to hit you than you are trying to dodge them. What you really need right about now is some comic relief. To that end, here's a machine that will be extremely annoying for a while before exploding. {^N}^o可能对聋子敌人无效。受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetNightblade=怪音发声器tagClassEngineerPetNightbladeAttack=搅扰tagClassEngineerPetNightbladeSuicide=引爆tagClassEngineerSkillNameArcanist=帕纳缇的导弹复制器^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionArcanist=The point where technology and magic meet is an exciting point indeed. Plenty of interesting things are possible when you can take dangerous amounts of magical energy and make a machine to handle it instead of your squishy soon-to-be-corpse. This machine is capable of launching a powerful version Panetti's classic missile at an impressive rate. The best part is not having to worry about your eyes exploding due to a magical overload. Know your limits, then make a machine to surpass them. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetArcanist=帕纳缇的导弹复制器tagClassEngineerPetArcanistAttack=复制导弹tagClassEngineerSkillNameShaman=雷电气象仪^k 「机师」^-tagClassEngineerSkillDescriptionShaman=You're very busy, but you still managed to find the time to create a giant storm-calling machine to cook your food for you. Stoves cook things too, sure, but this is way more hardcore. This machine will conjure up violent storm clouds at an alarming rate, which will cook any food in a decent radius nigh-instantly. Great for parties. You really do like the nice sear you get from lightning-cooked food, and you can't beat the speed. You could probably feed an army with little effort, this is the next big thing in the field of cooking! Just think of all the banquets you will host for people of high social standing! This thing is your ticket to the top! Oh, wait. Grim Dawn... right... They're all dead. REALLY dead. Oh well, this thing probably works on live targets, too. The thought didn't even cross your mind until now. {^N}^o受益于战宠加成。tagClassEngineerPetShaman=雷电气象仪tagClassEngineerPetShamanAttack=凝聚风暴云
